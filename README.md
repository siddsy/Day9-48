Network Analysis of Director-Company Relationships

Tools: Python, NetworkX, Pandas, Plotly

Skills: Network Visualization, Graph Theory, Centrality Analysis, Data Processing

Worked from Day 9 to Day 48, collaborating with NZ Superfund to deliver insights on director-company networks.

Developed an interactive network model to analyze relationships between directors and companies, visualizing influence patterns and cross-board connections.

Implemented centrality metrics (e.g., degree, betweenness, eigenvector centrality) to identify key influencers and understand their roles within the network.

Designed a dynamic timeline-based visualization to observe changes in director influence and company relationships over time, using Plotly for interactive analysis.

Conducted weighted edge analysis by incorporating factors such as tenure, market cap, and centrality, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the importance of each director.

Applied methods to reduce graph complexity for better clarity, including Kamada-Kawai and Spring Layouts, effectively managing the challenges of visualizing large, dense networks.
Generated summary statistics and identified key insights from the network, such as highly connected directors, clusters, and community dynamics.

Collaborated in a team to test and scale the analysis from a trial dataset to the full dataset, ensuring robustness and adaptability of the model to handle large-scale, complex networks.
